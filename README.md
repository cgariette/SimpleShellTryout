This code defines four functions for printing the command prompt, reading user input, parsing the input, and executing the command. In the main function, it repeatedly calls these functions to implement a simple shell program that can execute commands entered by the user.

Note that this is just a basic implementation and does not handle more advanced features such as input/output redirection, piping, or background processes.
